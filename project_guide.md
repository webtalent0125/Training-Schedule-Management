## How To Run?

- For running this project just run the `main.cpp` file and it will redirect you to `Homepage` of **Training Schedule Management** project and it will give you 3 options :
1. Admin Login
- For admin login you can use predefined username and password i,e, Username : admin and Password : 12345.
- After login successfully, it will give you access of all operations that an admin can perform.

**Note:** If an admin enters wrong username and password 3 times consecutively then the program will automatically stops and shows `ACCESS DENIED` to an admin.

2. Faculty Login
- For faculty login you can use predefined username and password which is already given in `facultyLogin.csv` file.
- After login successfully, it will give you access of all operations that a faculty can perform.

**Note:** Just like admin if a faculty also enters wrong username and password 3 times consecutively then the program will automatically stops and shows `ACCESS DENIED` to faculty.

3. Exit
- This option allows an user to exit from the program completely.
